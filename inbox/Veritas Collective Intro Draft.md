**Introducing The Veritas Collective (fka HarvardDAO)**

*Veritas Collective is a distributed venture community of Harvard-affiliated angels, founders, and investors that invest in the next generation of Harvard-affiliated founders.*

To truly understand *what* the Veritas Collective is, you must understand *why* it is.

# Our Values
## Building a startup is so much better with a rally of supporters
Being a founder is lonely. Veritas Collective deploys a minor check and a major community to every founder we work with. 
We are the beta-testers when they're struggling to learn from users. The cheerleaders when the macro-environments takes a 💩. The one investor on their cap table that *actually* can let them know we can be helpful ™️

## If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. 
Where a solo GP or solo angel can go, we can go 10x further.

## Our winning strategy: small checks, big impact. 
**Small checks**: the cost of innovation is dropping exponentially. If it's getting cheaper to start and scale a startup, check sizes should go down, not up. 
**Big impact**: Pre-seed/seed venture is fundamentally a services-based industry. We will not scale to become the next Tiger, and that's intentional. 

## Venture capital will be d̶e̶c̶e̶n̶t̶r̶a̶l̶i̶z̶e̶d̶ distributed.
Community-first venture organizations will unbundle a centralized, bureaucratic venture capital process. 

1. **Sourcing**: our collective networks are expansive.
2. **Due Diligence**: our collective intelligence gives us more expertise than any sole research team.
3. **Funding**: pooled capital helps spread risk and increase exposure to more outstanding founders. 
4. **Portfolio Growth**: Veritas Collective is a team of evangelists, super-connectors, and champions for our founder


## We seek positive-sum games via aligned incentives
Too many venture firms post abhorrent returns and still eat comfortable management fees. We are not fee vampires. We will not obfuscate our performance with vanity metrics. If we're not investing in real value-creating enterprises, we are doing something wrong (unfortunately, this needs to be said).

## To whom much is given, much is expected.
We went to one of the best schools in the world. We have an imperative to use the, cash capital and human capital to do something good with it. Veritas Collective will play its part in showing the power of collective action in supporting communities in hopes that we inspire more groups to replicate us, as we did with HarvardDAO (see History section).

## DAOs are more than just web3. 
DAOs encapsulate hundreds of years of experimenting with how people organize, except now it can rapidly iterate via code. The web3 ethos of balancing transparency throughout an organization, and yet privacy where important, is important to us. But what we invest in doesn't *have* to be web3, as it is only one of many unlocking technologies for the future. 

Most DAOs are constrained to (often illegal) NFT/token purchases when the majority of asset growth is happening off chain. Veritas Collective has a leg up with its ability to purchase any asset class (SAFE, convertible note, secondaries, SAFT, etc.) with full securities compliance. 

## Notes
### Time Commitment
Expect to join biweekly calls & coordinate async. *The best ability is availability.*

### Agreement of Non-Circumvention
Veritas Collective's deal flow is held strictly confidential. Specifically, you agree you will not leverage information you learn here to strike a deal with potential portfolio companies directly. Failure to comply will result in immediate kicking from the group.

### DBAA
This is a small group. Don't shill to it too much. Don't take more out of it than you give. Contribute where you can. Don't be an asshole. 

### Critical Decisions You'll be Making
1. **Thesis**: what qualifies a potential deal for investment? 
	1. Must be a Harvard affiliated founder? 
	2. Must be a web3 project? 
2. **Incentives**: how much do we incentivize each action? 
	1. *Sourcing* a deal the community hasn't seen yet
	2. *Championing* the deal through discussions/closing
	3. *Diligence* assistance
	4. *Portfolio Growth* after investment
3. **Fund automations**: how does the community change from pure syndication to a hybrid fund-syndicate model?

## What we achieved with HarvardDAO
- amassed thousands on the whitelist, brought in a sugroup into the Genesis
- became the first university to use venture DAO as a funding mechanism
- made 3 venture investments
- poured much time & $ into solving the legal problem
- advised 20+ venture DAOs
- took advice from the gold-standard in community-first VC, MetaCartel Ventures

## About Arda
*Arda is building an enterprise SaaS platform that turns existing delivery operators into drone delivery operators.* ^a5501c

Founder Jan took leave from Harvard after raising a pre-seed from Contrary Capital, Soma Capital, and HarvardDAO.

Secured a pilot contract with the Ministry of Health of The Gambia, who will use Arda to enable drone delivery across their 10 major health centers. Also won a commercial contract worth $XXX,XXX with a UK based healthcare organization with units across Africa.

## HarvardDAO is special to founders
"What [[HarvardDAO]] offers is on par with what the big venture capital funds offer in the startup industry."

A Genesis member (current PhD in Aerospace at MIT) advises Arda bi-weekly on US-entrance strategy & constantly opens his rolodex with FAA execs.

## Rebrand: HarvardDAO -> Veritas Collective
Funny enough, nobody from Harvard *ever* reached out to us with concerns over the name/trademark. We actually rebranded because:
1. **Harvard in the name was too on-the-nose**: there's a brilliant subtlety to Veritas– *truth* is both a unifying concept and a "IYKYK" nod to that "school you went to in Boston."
2. **DAO branding is limiting**. Aside from the mass-slaughtering of useless DAOs in the past 6 months, DAOs force us into a web3 corner. While the Collective will always use web3 tools, web3 ethos, and seek decentralization so we don't become *another fund that vampires around Harvard folks*, the name threw people off in thinking we *only* invest in web3 assets.

## The Distributed Venture Firm Model: Syndicate to Hybrid
 We'll begin with an open-syndication model with carry incentives for anyone to contribute to the full venture pipeline (sourcing, diligence, portfolio support teams/pods).
 Then, we'll upgrade to a hybrid fund-syndicate model for top investors/contributors to join the next season, where we add fund-like LPing/automations over syndicates, and decentralized governance rights to allocate LP capital.


## Angel-Operators
The next generation of investors will be founders-turned-investors. As a current founder/startup employee, you have on-the-ground insights on what the space looks like today and scar tissue to remember the mistakes of the past. 

So whether you're a founder looking to write your first micro-angel check, or a prolific angel seeking to invest in your alma mater's innovation scene before the TechCrunch stage, Veritas Collective will be a cornerstone experience in your journey as an investor. 

## Institutional Investors
Partners/associates at venture firms are eligible to join. Do read the non-circumvention clause: if this is an issue, don't join.

## Others
If you're actively involved as a scout, venture fellow, Harvard venture-oriented club, or org that can partner with Veritas Collective, you may also be eligible. 

## Harvard Affiliates Only
Alumni, faculty, staff, and select students are welcome across any Harvard school (College, HBS, HKS, SEAS, etc.)
